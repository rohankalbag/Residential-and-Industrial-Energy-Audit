# Analysis of energy consumption and connected loads via residential and industrial energy audit

## **Course Project - EN 110  - Spring Semester 2020 - Indian Institute of Technology Bombay**

## **Course Instructor - Prof S.B Kedare**

- Audited the energy usage of a residential home, after studying the daily consumption and connected loads.

- Used Python (matplotlib.pyplot library) to plot the typical power load curve of the residence and graphically found the maximum demand and average power and verified it with the monthly electricity bill.

- The code can be found <a href ="https://github.com/rohankalbag/Residential-and-Industrial-Energy-Audit/blob/main/Residential%20Audit.ipynb">here</a>

- The report can be found here <a href ="https://github.com/rohankalbag/Residential-and-Industrial-Energy-Audit/blob/main/Residential%20and%20Industrial%20Energy%20Audit%20-%20Report.pdf">here</a>

- Calculated individual energy consumption of connected loads and suggested improvements to reduce the
monthly bills.

- Also visited a nearby pumping station, examined the pumping equipment, did its energy audit and examined the energy flow diagram and suggested changes to improve its efficiency
